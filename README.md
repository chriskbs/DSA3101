# dsa3101-2310-01-library
Simulation and user dashboard to determine distribution and occupancy of library users

Workflow:
1. Fork the team repo (only need to do this once)
2. Clone the repo onto your computer (only need to do this once)
3. For backend, create `data` folder on your computer, then add the entry-exit data from the library to the `data/` folder only on your computer (`.gitignore` will ignore this folder automatically)
4. Make the changes
5. Commit to your own forked repo
6. Create a pull request with the changes to the team repo
7. 1 or 2 of us can review the PR
8. Merge (to be done by reviewer)
