# dsa3101-2310-01-library
Simulation and user dashboard to determine distribution and occupancy of library users

Workflow:
1. Fork the team repo (only need to do this once)
2. Clone the forked repo (yourusername/dsa3101-2310-library) onto your computer (only need to do this once)
3. Navigate to repo and type in terminal `git remote add git@github.com:dsa3101-2310-01-library/dsa3101-2310-01-library.git` (only need to do this once)
4. Need to do this every time: `git pull upstream`
5. For backend, create `data` folder on your computer, then add the entry-exit data from the library to the `data/` folder only on your computer (`.gitignore` will ignore this folder automatically)
6. Make the changes
7. Commit to your own forked repo
8. Create a pull request with the changes to the team repo
9. 1 or 2 of us can review the PR
10. Merge (to be done by reviewer)
