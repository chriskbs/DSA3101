# View Past Simulation Page

## Overview
The users can view all past simulations that the user has run on this page. 

The simulations are named using seat arrangement name and the simulated period. 

To give users a brief summary of the simulation, some scores will be included to briefly represent the overall performance of the simulations. 

Users could choose the simulation they are interested in and check out the simulation result. 

Furthermore, the user could choose any two simulations from the dropdown menu at the top to go to the Comparison Page and look at how they compare with each other.
